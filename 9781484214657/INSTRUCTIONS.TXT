The credit for all the Jekyll themes included in this archive belongs to the developers involved in the respective projects. Hats off to them for making this book possible.

Here, I want to document any known issues or special instructions needed to push the code included online to GitHub and see the project in action.

To push the code here, simply use the following three commands:
1. $ git init
2. $ git add -A :/
3. $ git commit -m "Initial commit"

After that, you would have created a Git repository locally. Now go to GitHub and create a root repository. After creating the root repository, you will see instructions for how to push an existing repository from the command line. 

They will look like the following:
1. $ git remote add origin <address>
2. $ git push -u origin master

===================================================================
===================================================================

Following is a list of any special instructions.

For all of these chapters, update the site.url variable in _config.yml file to your own root repository address on GitHub.

Set git.remote to your GitHub credentials for each repository in case you need to do multiple commits. See chapter 11 for instructions on how to do this:

$ git config remote.origin.url https://username:password@github.com/{USERNAME}/{REPONAME}.git

Chapter 8 and 9: You can push the code using the commands provided above, no special instructions required.

Chapter 10: Include output:true for each collection that you create, if you want to convert Markdown pages into HTML. See the already existing examples in _config.yml for the collection first and second.

Chapter 11: The code provided in the archive is missing the reveal.js submodule. This is because Git will not allow you push code from a submodule that hasn't been registered properly. To upload this code, you have to follow the following steps:

1. $ git init
2. $ git add -A :/
3. $ git commit -m "Initial commit"
4. $ git remote add origin <address>
5. $ git push -u origin master
6. $ git submodule add https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git
7. $ git add -A :/
8. $ git commit -m "Adding reveal.js"
9. $ git push

Chapter 12: No speical instructions

Chapter 13: Update the Rakefile with your own credentials or the build will fail. Make sure you also update the repository addresses from Bitbucket to your own.
